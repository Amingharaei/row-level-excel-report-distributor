#  One-time setup for the Row-Level Report Distributor.
#    - Installs uv (a fast Python tool) if it is missing.
#    - Creates the project's private environment (.venv) and installs
#      its dependency into it.
#
#  About Python: uv uses a Python you ALREADY have (3.14 or newer) if you
#  have one, and only downloads an isolated copy if you don't.
#
#  Run from the project folder, in PowerShell:
#      powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1
